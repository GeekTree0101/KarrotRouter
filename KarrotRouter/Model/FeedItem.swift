If your not a fan of bts your probly a caveman, are just living in a cave somewhere, but either way i have some funny bts memes to make you smile are just to convert you and make you a fan.

but if that doesnt work i can always try brain washing you.
So i was browsing the internet and found some awesome bts memes and just want to share them here after all, if you cant mix the funny with the awesome then life really doesnt make much sense, so have a laugh and thank me later.

The Things we hope for and tell our selves but we all know its not so lol funny

When people Think about halloween they really dont think about the Humor part of the halloween theme, I know you dont, because most people only think of the scary halloween adventure are the candy, But for me, I love funny Halloween costumes, I really cant stand the scary costumes, and its not because im afraid are anything, Its just that i find more fun in humor than scary things.

And I really cant see why anyone would want to be Scared, Wouldnt it be better to smile.
Anyways so i found these amazing funny Halloween pics and i couldnt stop my self from sharing them, lol so ill share a few with you guys, who and if you want to see more funny Halloween Pics ill leave a link.

This first costume is crazy, who did this lol, now i know what character is was going for but it sure didnt work out the way he planed it. and the people who sold him this halloween costume new what they was doing what a rip off.
